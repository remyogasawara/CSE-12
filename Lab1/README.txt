Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION

This lab practices working with MMLogic and uses logic to create circuits out of the given truth tables.
Part A: Connect the wires to make the counter work.
Part B: Create a circuit that matches the given outputs.
Part C: Create a circuit that matches the given outputs using SOP or POS, then change that circuit to use only NAND gates, then change that circuit to use only NOR gates.
