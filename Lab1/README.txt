Lab 1 Intro to Logic Simulation
This lab practices working with MMLogic and creating truth tables that are used to make circuits.
Uses logic to create circuits that match the given outputs.
A: Match the wires to make the counter work.
B: Create a circuit that matches the given outputs.
C: Create a circuit that matches the given outputs using SOP or POS, then change that circuit to use only NAND gates, then change that circuit to use only NOR gates.
