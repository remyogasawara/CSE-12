Lab 5: Functions and Graphics

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, we implement macros and functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. These functions allow users to change the background color of the display, draw and retrieve pixels, draw horizontal and vertical lines on the display, and draw crosshairs.

FILES

Lab5.asm
This file includes the pseudocode and written code. This holds the code for all of the functions and macros. This file should compile, but has no output.

INSTRUCTIONS

This program is run on MARS in MIPS ISA. To run the program, compile the code by clicking the tool button from the toolbar. Then click the green play button in the toolbar to run the code. To run the display, go under "Tools," click "Bitmap Display." The settings of the bitmap display should be 128 x 128 pixels and the base address of the memory may should be 0xffff_0000. Then click "Connect to MIPS" to run the display.
