Lab 2: Simple Data Path

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, we built a sequential logic circuit using data paths, and implemented a left arithmetic shift by building a ALU. The ALU shifted 4-bit values. We built registers to store values, and implemented logic to chose between four registers.

INSTRUCTIONS

This program is run on MMLogic (Windows). Run the simulator by clicking the green play button from the toolbar. Click the switch on the schematic to change the inputs. Click the red stop button from the toolbar to stop the stimulator. 
First clear the registers by pushing the clear button. Then, use the store select to decide whether to get the register value from the alu output or the keypad. Use the switches under the write register address to select a register. ALU input 1 decides the number of shifts. ALU input 2 decides what input is getting shifted.
